(November 2024 - December 2024)


This is a personal project of mine that i ended up abandoning. I was learning frontend developpement and decided to use vuejs for the first time. At that time I didn't know react was the industry standard so I chose vue because I heard it was very similar in terms of performance but easier synthax. Go on the backend was a choice because I was tired of python slowness and especially not typed variable making it stressful when running in prod. Go was faster and had a type system so very happy to have used it for that kind of project (where speed wasn't a concern haha).

It just was a good learning experience and I am happy that I did this project has it allowed me to discover new frameworks and languages. Nothing more to say. :)
