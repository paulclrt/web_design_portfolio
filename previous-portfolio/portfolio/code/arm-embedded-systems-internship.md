(January 2024 - Febuary 2024)


This internship was done in LEDES (Laboratory for the Study and Development of Space Electronic Systems) @ CEA Saclay.
It consisted of testing the functionality of an ARM board from microchip: ATSAMV71 with the processor Q21B.
The testing of the board was done by me to see its capabilities and ease of developpement to later present them to the member of the laboratory for its usage on a next project.

I had to develop lots of tiny application demonstrating the board functionalities like: uart communication, I2C and interacting with other components. These application source code will serve as documentation for the team at LEDES to then build on it.
Along the different codes and application I had to build (there was more than just communication protocol, like: oled display of data, temperature sensing...), I wrote down 70 pages of documentation to fill the gaps in the one microchip wrote.

The board is for advanced used and therefor doesn't have a lot of active developpers. Documentation is scarce and debugging difficult. My worked serve to lay the fundation for the team to then use it for spatial application and future project.
