(October 2023 - November 2023)

School project made by me and 2 other friends. We had to build an ECG using an arduino nano, a led heartbeat sensor for the finger and other common components.

Functionalities are:
1. reading acurate heartbeat
2. displaying heartbeat on OLED display during measure
3. history of bpm inside EEPROM memory
4. interactive display using potentiometer and buttons
5. Easy led explaination telling user how good is it ? (low, normal, too high)


The goal of this project as a first year student was more to learn about electronics hands on. Having simple expectations and learing to be ressourceful to find solutions to common problems.
That is why the arduino was used and not other mcus like stm32... But most component interaction was written by hand though.
