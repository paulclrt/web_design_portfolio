(January 2025 - NOW)


I started doing freelance recently. It is something that I long wanted to do because it allowed me to create and put into action what I learned. I started programming in middle school and being able to do something with that skill was something very satisfying for me. I mostly do freelance gigs for full stack and not cybersecurity/AI because it is an area very demanded and easier to do when working remote. It doesn't require a lot of computing power but provides a lot of value to the business I am working for.

So: fullstack, seo, web design... That is what I do. I had a few clients over the past few months. And it allowed me to make money while I am still studying.

Here is some of the review that I got:
