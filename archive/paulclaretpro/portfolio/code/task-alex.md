(January 2025 - January 2025)


This is a simple project that a client asked me to do for him. He need a software that allowed him to manage task for his team internally. He didn't want comercial software. So this app was developped this app using react, websockets, express and deployed everything using serverless as the client requested to cut costs.

The project code was hosted on gitub of the client and he was very satisfied with the result:
