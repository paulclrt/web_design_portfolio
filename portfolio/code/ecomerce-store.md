(December 2024 - Decmber 2024)


There was no reason for me to do this project. It was christmass holiday and I was just thinking about what I could build, that I had not built yet for the web. At that time I had never used mongodb, stripe and expressjs. So the idea came quickly. Lets build an ecomerce store.

The goal was mainly learning and doing clean code. I didn't want any bug or stripe security failure. So i focused largely on that and not the UI (I used bootstrap for that xD... I know not pretty but the code and security is). There is an administrator interface allowing the user to upload new products, connect them to stripe for payement... Overall fun project, I did it in a rush (3 days) because I was running out of holidays and had an internship comming up.
